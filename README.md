# PYSNAKE
Yet another snake clone made with PyGame

## Information

### About
Full disclosure - I'm making this so that I have something to do at work whenever I stop working for a minute.
Also, I thought it'd be fun to make a Snake clone because I love the game and I've never made one before

### Getting Started
Here's a tough one - to play the game, download the only other file in the repo, and then run it with [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (look at me using links 'n such like a real software developer)

## TODO
- Make a leaderboard and store scores in a database (probably with MySQL)
- ~~Make it better?~~ (this was determined to be impossible, as this game is clearly flawless)

# From the Developer
Howdy! Preston Carlton (lead developer, designer, artist, level designer, tester, and project manager) here. I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for trying out this here "game" (if that's what you want to call it). Just a heads up - I made this solely to see how fast I could make the game. You'll notice that between the initial commit and the commit titled "version 1.0", around 2 hours elapsed. I took one or two potty breaks and also made some cookies, and then got distracted in the last 15 minutes and played around (and broke a few times) this wonderful piece of art you have here in front of you. If you find any bugs, go ahead and make a pull request, because I really would be intrigued to see if this game is even complex enough to be able to have bugs.
